\section{Introduction}

MedChain investigates how redactable blockchains can satisfy the GDPR Right to Erasure without abandoning the auditability healthcare regulators require. The project combines the chameleon hash redaction scheme by Ateniese et al.\ with the governance extensions proposed by Avitabile et al., delivering a permissioned ledger that allows controlled history updates while keeping cryptographic proofs verifiable. The scope covered by this deliverable spans the Python-based simulator, Solidity smart contracts, zero-knowledge tooling, and documentation needed to demonstrate the end-to-end workflow for privacy-preserving medical record management.

The current iteration emphasises a research-grade prototype that privileges correctness, traceability, and reproducibility over raw performance. Key accomplishments include: (i) a modular blockchain core that supports redactable blocks and role-based governance policies, (ii) an operational Groth16 proof pipeline built on circom/snarkjs and integrated with the medical redaction engine, (iii) encrypted IPFS storage with deterministic links between on-chain commitments and off-chain payloads, and (iv) a growing test suite and documentation set that anchor the implementation to compliance requirements. Remaining gaps---notably contract-orchestrated execution of redactions and production-grade consistency proofs---are tracked in the roadmap and inform the next development cycle.
