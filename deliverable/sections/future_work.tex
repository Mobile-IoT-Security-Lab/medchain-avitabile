\section{Future Work}

Remaining tasks span protocol hardening, usability improvements, and compliance sign-off. The backlog in \texttt{todo.md} is the authoritative source; highlights are summarised here to guide the next development cycle.

\subsection{Immediate Next Steps: Circuit Recompilation}

My top priority is to rebuild the Groth16 artifacts so the 16 public signals defined in the circuit source finally reach the verifier. Appendix~A.1.3 already lists the steps; in short I need to install circom/snarkjs, rerun the compile/setup scripts, switch the Solidity ABI to \texttt{uint[16]}, drop the timestamp-based nullifier shim, and rerun the Hardhat integration tests. I estimate two to four hours once the tooling is in place. When that job is done the nullifier registry will consume real limb data, the Solidity verifier will stop returning \texttt{false}, and the gas numbers in Table~\ref{tab:phase2_performance} can come from measurements instead of projections.

\subsection{Short-Term Priorities (Post-Recompilation)}

After the recompilation I plan to tighten the test suite around the new behaviour (failed-proof paths, policy violations, IPFS edge cases), produce updated architecture and compliance diagrams, wire the batch-verification path for cheaper multi-request submissions, and add monitoring hooks so I can see proof failures or contract reverts in a deployed environment.

\subsection{Long-Term Vision}

Longer term I want to run this stack on a managed permissioned chain, gather latency and throughput numbers, and explore formal methods for both the contracts and the circuit. I also see value in a lightweight operator dashboard for approvals and audits, integrations with hospital systems (FHIR, consent registries), and—if the workload justifies it—recursive SNARK aggregation to shrink on-chain costs.
