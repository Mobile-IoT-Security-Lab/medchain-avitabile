\section{Future Work}

Remaining tasks span protocol hardening, usability improvements, and compliance sign-off. The backlog in \texttt{todo.md} is the authoritative source; highlights are summarised here to guide the next development cycle.

\subsection{Short-Term Priorities}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Complete end-to-end smart contract orchestration: invoke Groth16 verification and proof-of-consistency checks from \texttt{MedicalDataManager.sol} before allowing state changes.
    \item Extend the circom circuit and mapper to ingest consistency proof data, enforcing state-transition validity inside the proof system.
    \item Finalise the censored medical dataset pipeline by automating policy-based anonymisation, IPFS publication, and on-chain/off-chain linkage tests.
    \item Add negative-path testing for proof verification, policy breaches, and IPFS redaction edge cases to increase confidence ahead of demonstrations.
    \item Produce architecture diagrams and compliance mapping artefacts that visualise data flow and reference relevant GDPR/HIPAA clauses.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Long-Term Vision}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Deploy the solution on a managed permissioned blockchain and evaluate operational characteristics such as latency, throughput, and key management at scale.
    \item Investigate formal verification of smart contracts and circuits to strengthen assurance guarantees demanded by healthcare regulators.
    \item Introduce a role-aware operator dashboard that surfaces approvals, audit logs, and redaction history to non-technical stakeholders.
    \item Explore interoperability with existing health information systems (FHIR APIs, consent registries) to streamline data ingestion and audit trails.
\end{itemize}
