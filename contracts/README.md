Contracts package
=================

This folder contains the Hardhat project for MedChain smart contracts.

CI runs solidity-coverage on pushes to this directory and publishes a badge at `badges/solidity-coverage.svg` in the repo root. Coverage will be low or 0% until tests are added under `contracts/test/`.
